# Operators in cpp
An operator is a symbol that operates on a value to perform specific mathematical or logical computations. They form the foundation of any programming language. In C++, we have built-in operators to provide the required functionality.

# Types Of Operators 
Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:
1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Relational Operators
3.Logical Operators
4.Bitwise Operators
5.Assignment Operators
6.Ternary or Conditional Operators

# Information About Operators
**-Arithmetic Operators:** Used for basic math operations, including +, -, *, /, and %.

**-Relational Operators:** Used for comparisons, such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.

**-Logical Operators:** Allow combining conditions, using &&, ||, and !.

**-Bitwise Operators:** Perform operations on bits, including &, |, ^, ~, <<, and >>.

**-Assignment Operators:** Assign values and can perform operations like =, +=, -=, *=, and /=.

**-Increment/Decrement Operators:** Increase or decrease a variable's value by one (++ and --).
# Conclusion 
In THis Experiment we have studied about the operators in cpp and implement programs for it.
